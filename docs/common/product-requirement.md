### **1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**1.1. Introduction & Problem Statement**
Procurement professionals operate in a fast-paced environment where they must efficiently source, evaluate, and manage relationships with a vast number of suppliers. The current process is heavily reliant on manual data entry, fragmented communication channels, and time-consuming research. This leads to missed opportunities, administrative overhead, and difficulty in tracking supplier interactions effectively. Our solution, an AI-native Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) Co-pilot, aims to automate and streamline these workflows through an intuitive, conversational interface.

**1.2. User Persona**
*   **Name:** Alex, the Procurement Specialist
*   **Role:** Responsible for identifying, negotiating with, and managing suppliers for a mid-to-large-sized enterprise.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Find the best-fit suppliers that meet specific technical and business requirements.
    *   Reduce the time spent on administrative tasks like data entry and follow-ups.
    *   Maintain an organized and up-to-date database of all supplier interactions and statuses.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   Manually entering new supplier details into a CRM/spreadsheet is tedious and error-prone.
    *   Sourcing new suppliers for niche requirements is a manual and inefficient research process.
    *   Forgetting to follow up on deadlines or with key contacts.

**1.3. Goals & Objectives**
*   **Primary Goal:** To drastically reduce the time and manual effort required for supplier sourcing and relationship management.
*   **Secondary Goal:** To improve the quality of supplier leads through intelligent, AI-powered data enrichment and filtering.
*   **Business Objective:** To create a focused, high-value tool for the procurement niche that serves as a foundation for a scalable, agentic enterprise platform.

**1.4. Features & Scope**

*   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**
    *   **F1: Conversational Data Entry:** Users can add and update supplier information in the database through natural language messages in Slack.
    *   **F2: Core Database Integration:** A robust backend pipeline that parses user intent and performs read/write operations on an SQLLite database.
    *   **F3: Basic Data Retrieval:** Users can query the database for supplier information directly from Slack (e.g., "What's the status with Supplier X?").

*   **Post-MVP (Future Enhancements):**
    *   **F4: Data Enrichment:** An agentic tool that automatically performs web searches to find missing data (e.g., contact emails, business addresses) for a given supplier.
    *   **F5: Automated Reminders:** A scheduled agent that notifies the user of upcoming deadlines or required follow-ups.
    *   **F6: Automated Outreach:** An agent that can draft initial contact emails to new suppliers based on predefined templates and context.

**1.5. Success Metrics**
*   **Adoption:** Number of weekly active users.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduction in average time spent per user on adding/updating supplier records.
*   **Effectiveness:** Increase in the number of qualified suppliers sourced per week.
*   **User Satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback and a Net Promoter Score (NPS).

### **2. User Stories**

*   **US1 (Data Entry):** As a Procurement Specialist, I want to add a new supplier by sending a single message in Slack, so that I can capture information quickly without switching applications.
*   **US2 (Data Retrieval):** As a Procurement Specialist, I want to ask the co-pilot for the latest update on a specific supplier, so that I can get immediate context before a meeting.
*   **US3 (Sourcing):** As a Procurement Specialist, I want to request a list of suppliers based on specific criteria (e.g., "Find me suppliers for custom microchips in California"), so that I can accelerate my sourcing process.
*   **US4 (Data Enrichment):** As a Procurement Specialist, I want the system to automatically find the primary contact email for a newly added company, so I don't have to perform manual web research.
*   **US5 (Reminders):** As a Procurement Specialist, I want to be automatically reminded about follow-up deadlines I've set, so that I never miss an important touchpoint.
*   **US6 (Email Automation):** As a Procurement Specialist, I want the co-pilot to draft an introductory email to a potential new supplier, so that I can initiate contact with just one click.

*   The system shall perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a designated Airtable database.
*   The system shall return formatted, easy-to-read responses to the user within the Slack interface.

**3.2. Non-Functional Requirements**
*   **Performance:** All user queries must receive a response within 5 seconds.
*   **Usability:** The conversational interface must be intuitive, requiring no specialized training.
*   **Security:** All API keys, tokens, and sensitive data must be managed via secure environment variables and not be hardcoded.
*   **Modularity:** The architecture must support the addition of new tools (e.g., email, calendar, web search) with minimal changes to the core backend logic.
